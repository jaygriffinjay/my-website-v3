This is my website where I publish all my software development work and some personal stuff too!

Written entirely in TypeScript using React, Next.js, and Emotion. 

To learn more about this project I would browse the meta docs on the site itself at /docs.

## Getting Started
Clone this repo and then:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
