# Career Focus: AI Product Engineering & Super Search Vision

## Timeline & Goal
- **Target:** AI product engineer role by end of 2026
- **Timeline:** 11.5 months
- **Priority:** Ship polished, public work demonstrating AI-native product thinking

## Career Positioning

### Core Competencies
- Building AI-native applications with LLM structured outputs
- Natural language interfaces (NLI) for command execution and search
- Semantic search, embeddings, RAG, hybrid retrieval
- Full-stack development (TypeScript, React, Emotion CSS-in-JS)
- Product sense backed by business/financial domain expertise

### Differentiators
- Can ship production AI products end-to-end
- Understand business viability and unit economics (Master of Accountancy + BS Economics)
- Think in AI-native patterns from the ground up
- Domain expertise in finance and business operations

## The Two Sites Strategy

### jaygriff.com (Personal Site)
**Purpose:** Interactive publishing platform and portfolio

**Architecture:**
- Not a traditional blog - a programmable publishing machine
- Content is TSX programs, not markdown posts
- Framework improvements benefit all content (multiplicative effect)

**Stack:**
- TypeScript, React, Emotion (CSS-in-JS)
- Custom design token system (Tailwind-inspired)
- Metadata-driven routing (frontmatter-style objects in TSX)
- Feature-based architecture
- Custom primitive components and theme system

**Content Types:**
- Interactive technical posts
- AI conversation transcripts
- Ideas and notes connected to projects/topics
- Live demos and visualizations
- Long-form technical articles

### pigbeach.dev (Company Site)
**Purpose:** Commercial products only

**Status:** Parked until products are ready to sell

## Current Projects

### Time Blocking App
**Status:** Functional, used daily, hosted on Lovable

**Features:**
- AI NLI for scheduling tasks from natural language input
- Fast parsing of arbitrary time/task requests
- Demonstrates LLM structured outputs → app state manipulation

**Strategy:** 
- Document as-is with screenshots/demo
- Write technical post about the NLI implementation
- Production migration deferred

### jaygriff.com Framework
**Status:** Production-ready, open source

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy to production
- Document through interactive technical posts

## Super Search Vision

### Overview
A command palette interface for navigating the entire site - unified search and command execution rather than traditional navigation.

### Capabilities

**Search Queries:**
- "show me all posts about react architecture"
- "what did i write about databases last month"
- "find my running blog ideas"
- "recent AI transcripts"

**Commands:**
- Create new content
- Filter by content type, topic, date
- Navigate to projects
- Execute site-wide actions

### Technical Implementation
- LLM-powered intent parsing
- Metadata extraction from TSX files
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Keyboard-first UX

### Strategic Value

**For Portfolio:**
- Demonstrates semantic search implementation
- Shows AI-native UX thinking
- Proves end-to-end feature delivery
- Generates technical content about the architecture

**For Product Vision:**
- Defines the site's interaction paradigm
- Drives richer metadata across all content
- Transforms site into queryable knowledge graph

## Product Ideas (AI-Native Patterns)

Recurring theme: reimagining existing software with AI-native interfaces

- **Financial data categorizer:** LLM-powered smart categorization
- **Hybrid search for legacy apps:** Semantic search retrofitting
- **AI-native app reimagining:** NLI command execution models
- **Site super search:** Command palette for knowledge graphs
- **AI metadata layer:** Automatic keyword enhancement

## Execution Plan

### Month 1
- Ship homepage/nav/about
- Deploy site to production
- Plan super search architecture

### Month 2-3
- Build super search feature (4-6 weeks)
- Implement semantic search and hybrid retrieval
- Polish for production use

### Month 3-4
- Write technical posts about super search implementation
- Document time blocking app architecture
- Polish portfolio presentation

### Portfolio Status (Target: April 2026)
- Live site with AI-native publishing
- Two AI product examples (time blocker + super search)
- Technical writing explaining approach
- Open source implementation

## Scope Management

**Not prioritizing:**
- Time blocking app infrastructure migration
- Theme editor enhancements
- Additional experimental features

**Focus only on:**
- Shipping the core site
- Building super search
- Creating portfolio content

## Key Architectural Decisions

### On Content Publishing
- TSX files as primary content format
- Metadata-driven organization
- Feature-based repo structure
- Co-located styles with components

### On the Time Blocking App
- Production migration deferred
- Focus on documentation and explanation
- Demonstrates concept without infrastructure overhead

### On the Site
- Framework improvements are multiplicative
- Publishing workflow evolves over time
- The framework itself is a portfolio piece

## Meta-Publishing Approach

This document represents the working process itself as publishable content. Strategic thinking, architectural decisions, and project evolution are all part of the portfolio narrative.

The site becomes a record of both the work and the thinking behind it.
